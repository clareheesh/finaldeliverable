							<h3>Product and Context</h3>
							<p>CoLab is a web application that aims to improve the group work experience by helping 
							groups work and communicate more effectively. Aiming to facilitate effective group management, 
							CoLab expands on the connectivity features of existing applications, such as chat and file 
							management, to incorporate a more “feelings” focussed atmosphere. The application allows 
							users to connect with each other and form groups to aide in the completion of group goals and 
							tasks, and also actively promotes continued engagement and contribution from all members.</p>
							<br />

							<p>As far as technical details go, CoLab was intended by the client as a web application, 
							and has been developed as such, as to optimise its functionality and universality. The front 
							end of CoLab is programmed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, whilst the back end utilises PHP and 
							interacts with databases via mySQL. CoLab is also built using Bootstrap and Laravel, which 
							were decisions made by the previous design group. Bootstrap aids in providing aesthetic 
							templates for the application and ease of scalability across multiple devices (e.g. phones 
							and tablets), and Laravel facilitates easy PHP coding, with various features and templating 
							options to promote flexible and reliable development.</p>
							<br />

							<p>The context for the application comes from the client’s desire for an application that 
							targets the “soft”, emotional issues of group work, as there is a perceived market hole 
							for these types of products. The problem is identifying the discrepancy between the “soft” 
							and “hard” elements of group work, whereby “hard” elements include work quality and meeting 
							deadlines, whereas “soft” elements encompass personal aspects such as whether or not group 
							members are getting along and whether or not individuals are highly stressed. </p>
							<br />

							<p>An outcomes-oriented development process has been implemented as per the expression 
							of the client, whereby emphasis is entirely upon the success of users being able to feel 
							a heightened sense of group cohesion.The client has stressed that the application should 
							strive for real-world marketability, and the focus upon the “soft” issues of group work 
							is the defining factor in this respect. </p>
							<br />

							<p>Expanding on the connectivity of traditional, existing applications such as chat, 
							file management and group management, the distinguishing features of CoLab that ensure 
							its “soft” focus are its stress management and achievements features. The addition of 
							these features means that users are more motivated to be engaged and interactive within 
							their team, and more emotional investment into group work is generated.</p>
							<br />

							<p>The implementation of a stress management feature aims to address the difficulty of 
							letting other group members know when you are anxious about the current workload or deadlines. 
							The ability to self document stress and unintrusively let other teammates know how you feel is 
							a feature that the client agrees will help in fostering a more prosperous and harmonious team 
							environment. CoLab offers stress advice to users that report feeling higher levels of stress, 
							and coupled with the support of other teammates, this mechanic aims to increase the ability for 
							groups to combat anxiety and stress.</p>
							<br />

							<p>The achievements feature is the other main feature that is tailored to directly improving 
							group cohesion and motivation, seeking to provide group members with a heightened sense of 
							active involvement and collaboration when they complete their assigned duties. The ability to 
							recognise members individually or as a group for the completion of tasks and milestones helps 
							create a sense of purpose and drives users to maximise their contribution and effort. </p>
							<br />

							<h3>Client Profile</h3>

							<p>The initial proposal for this project was presented by Dr Ralf Muhlberger from The Latest 
							Tricks. Dr Muhlberger was previously a member of faculty at the University of Queensland 
							and has an academic background in technology and education. His company, The Latest Tricks, 
							is a consultancy firm that seeks to help clients gain a business advantage by helping them to 
							incorporate cutting edge technologies into their business practices.</p>
							<br />

							<p>Throughout the semester, our contact with Dr Muhlberger consisted of meetings and emails. 
							Dr Muhlberger was of great assistance to our process by clearly outlining his outcomes-based 
							development philosophies, and educating us with his industry experience. From his advice on 
							how we should sit down within our groups and talk about exactly what we aim to take away from 
							the course, to his demonstration of his strategic planning framework, his prior knowledge of 
							the course and process meant that he was an invaluable asset to our group.</p>
							<br />

							<h3>Documentation Overview</h3>

							<p>This document seeks to thoroughly detail the process and results of our development over 
							the course of the semester, including our user testing, evaluations and our own assessment of 
							the finished application. The structure, as outlined in the contents page, consists of an 
							executive overview, a user startup guide, a frequently asked questions section, a deployment and 
							installation manual for administrators, functional testing results, a user experience review, 
							an essay that critically evaluates our group’s experience in the course, and a set of appendices 
							that include our exhibition poster and link to our kickstarter video. </p>
							<br />

							<p>The document represents a culmination of the semester’s work, and each team member has 
							contributed to the sections that are relevant to their role within the group.</p>
